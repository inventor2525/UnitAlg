# Type conversion by dictionary of types that can be statically appended to -- Or, can I do magic in the init file that the ide will pick up on?
# iterate keys of dictionary after un-successfull lookups to check for sub classing, appending new keys to dictionary to maintain future speed
# is there an existing method in python for this?
